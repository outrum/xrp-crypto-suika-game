# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing Suika/Watermelon game into an XRP meme-themed puzzle game where players drop and merge popular XRP ecosystem tokens. The game will feature a secret code reveal system that unlocks exclusive content when players reach specific score milestones, creating an engaging reward mechanism that encourages continued play and social sharing. The game will be deployed to Netlify and use Supabase for data persistence.
