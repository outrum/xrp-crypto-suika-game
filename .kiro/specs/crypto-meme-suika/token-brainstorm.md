# XRP Ecosystem Token Design

This document outlines the design choices and visual prompts for the XRP ecosystem tokens used in the Crypto Meme Suika game.

## Token Design Philosophy

The tokens are designed to:
1. Be visually recognizable as part of the XRP ecosystem
2. Follow a progression from smaller to larger elements in the XRP ecosystem
3. Have a consistent circular design with white background for game integration
4. Include XRP branding elements (colors, symbols, terminology)
5. Be visually distinct from each other while maintaining a cohesive style

## Token Hierarchy

The tokens progress from smallest to largest as follows:

1. **Baby Ripple** (Smallest) - The beginning of the XRP journey
2. **XRP Coin** - The basic unit of the XRP ecosystem
3. **Rocket Fuel** - Representing the potential energy of XRP
4. **Diamond Hands** - Symbolizing holding through volatility
5. **HODL Shield** - Protection against market fluctuations
6. **Crypto Whale** - Large holders in the ecosystem
7. **Rocket Launch** - The upward momentum of XRP
8. **Moon Base** - Establishing presence beyond Earth (metaphor for adoption)
9. **Crypto Galaxy** - Expanding influence across the financial universe
10. **Interstellar XRP** - XRP as a dominant force in the cosmos
11. **Crypto God** (Largest) - The ultimate form of XRP's potential
