## ⚙️ Next Steps: Configure Supabase Environment Variables

The site is deployed but needs Supabase environment variables to enable data persistence and leaderboard functionality.

### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/projects/memesuika
   - Navigate to **Site settings > Environment variables**

2. **Set Required Variables**
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL = https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJ... (your anonymous key)
   ```

3. **Redeploy**
   - Trigger a new deployment to apply the variables

### Option 2: Netlify CLI

```bash
# Set Supabase URL
netlify env:set VITE_SUPABASE_URL "https://your-project.supabase.co"

# Set Supabase Anonymous Key
netlify env:set VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY "eyJ..."

# Redeploy with new environment variables
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Getting Supabase Credentials

1. **Create Supabase Project** (if not done already)
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Create a new project or select existing one

2. **Get Credentials**
   - Navigate to **Settings > API**
